1. Overview



	The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve determine the best stock options for his parents based on years of data.  We utilized this data to provide an summary of the stock returns to help with reinvesting. After the initial run through, we were asked to provide a faster method of acquiring the information. Steve requested we look outside the "green" stocks to ensure the funding is being invested correctly.

	 The original code took almost 1 second to run, while the refactored took .1 seconds. 2017 was a much better year for many of the stocks. Averaging +67% return, while 2018 had an average of -8%. While this may not seem to be a huge time savings upfront as Steve adds more data to his set, it will continue to compound and further decrease the amount of time needed to run the script.


3. Summary

	 The advantage of refactoring the code is it leads to a quicker processing time, it can also make the code easier to comprehend. A disadvantage is that it may add in new bugs that didn't exist in the original code.
	 
	
	 The pro of refactoring the code for this analysis is it displays the shorter amount of time needed for processing. It is also much easier to write additons to an already made code instead of starting from scratch. A con of refactoring the original script similar to the disadvantage for refectoring in general, is that any small mistake can lead to the code not properly functioning. This led to me spending many hours reviewing the code to ensure it was up to par.
